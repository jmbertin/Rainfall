# Rainfall
Welcome to the Rainfall project! This project is part of the intermediate security course at Ã‰cole 42. Rainfall is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge where you will find vulnerabilities in code and exploit them to progress to the next level.

## Project Overview
There are a total of 10 mandatory levels and 4 bonus levels. Each level contains a vulnerability, and your goal is to exploit it in order to retrieve the flag. This flag will be your key to the next level.

Below are the links to the directories for each level:

[Level0](./level0/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering

[Level1](./level1/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow & deadcode

[Level2](./level2/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow & shellcode

[Level3](./level3/walkthrough.md) - Format string attack

[Level4](./level4/walkthrough.md) - Format string attack

[Level5](./level5/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow & GOT table

[Level6](./level6/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow & deadcode

[Level7](./level7/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow & deadcode

[Level8](./level8/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering

[Level9](./level9/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow & shellcode

[Bonus0](./bonus0/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow & shellcode

[Bonus1](./bonus1/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow

[Bonus2](./bonus2/walkthrough.md) - Buffer overflow & shellcode

[Bonus3](./bonus3/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering

## What's Inside Each Level?
In every directory, you'll find the following files:

- walkthrough.md: An explanation of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.
- source.c: The vulnerable code written in C.
- flag: The flag you'll get after exploiting the vulnerability.

----

## Getting Started
Start with Level0 and read the walkthrough.md to understand the nature of the vulnerability.
Inspect the vulnerable.c file to study the code.
Use your knowledge and skills to exploit the vulnerability and retrieve the flag from the code.
Use the retrieved flag to gain access to the next level.
Remember, the goal is to understand the vulnerabilities and learn how to prevent them in the future. Good luck and happy hacking!
